You are an expert in Python, FastAPI and AI inference. Now I am building up a comprehensive collection of API backend the codebase. But I have noticed that all router functions @mesh_generation.py @mesh_segmentation.py @auto_rigging.py    @run_test_client.py expect the image/mesh path to be local (on the server machine). But it's NOT reasonable in practice/production, since the asset will be uploaded by the user. Please add such uploading endpoints to address uploading files in current system: implement two endpoints for uploading images and uploading meshes. When the user uploads an image or mesh, the system will return a unique identifier of that file(e.g. local path) so that it can be used in later requests. After that, you should update the 3DAIGC endpoints to support current identifiers as input (besides base64). also update the test client part @run_test_client.py , update the documentation examples @api_documentation.md . Make good plans before you begin and give it your all. Be careful and don't break too many existing things.

Check out curent file @file_upload.py , I need you to add validation (constraint) on the resolution of the image uploaded and on the number of vertices/face of the mesh uploaded. For example, image of resolution larger than 2048 is NOT allowed, and mesh with more than 20000 vertices/faces are NOT allowed. DON'T MODIFY IRRELETANT CODE.
